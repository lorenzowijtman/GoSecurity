# GoSecurity
This repository is one of the assignments developed during the class 'Software Security' at the [University of Alicante](https://www.ua.es/). Since this was a final year subject taught in Spanish, parts of this application are also written in Spanish.

## Goal
The goal of this application was to create an application in GoLang that send encrypted files to a server using the following steps.
1. Take any file as input and use AES to encrypt it
2. Send the file to the server
3. retrieve the file and decrypt it
